# Hall effect Sensor Library for STM32
Project that measures rpm of a wheel/gear with a signal from a Hall Effect Sensor. 
The Hall effect signal is pulled up both externally (where the sensor is) and inside the STM, to become noise-proof. So it triggers my function when there is a falling edge, hence the wheel done a full rotation(the magnet is the reference).
It has been tested on a NUCLEO-F446RE.

If anything, feel free to message me.

Developed for DRT's Electric Vehicle for the season 23/24
